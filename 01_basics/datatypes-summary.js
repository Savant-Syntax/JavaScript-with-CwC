//Datatypes are defind in 2-types: Primitive and Non-pritive

//Primitive => Call by value => Change done in copy of code not reflected in actual code.
//7 types: string, number, boolean, null, undefined, symbol, bigInt

//Non-premitive => Call by reference => Change done in here reflected in the actual code.
//tyles: array, object, functions

//2 Types of languages: Static and Dynamic

//Static => datatypes need to be defined while declaring the variables.

//dyamic => we don't need this
const age = 20; //here age acan be number, string etc
//* That's why Javascript is a dyanimcally typed language


//object
const heros = ["shaktiman", "naagraj", "doga"];
let myObj = {
    name: "astrak",
    age: 20,
}
